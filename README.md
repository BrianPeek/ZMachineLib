# ZMachineLib

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ig4abc31j6imrypw?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BrianPeek/zmachinelib)

An incomplete ZMachine interpreter written in C#.  This library supports v1-v5, but v5 is not complete.  The code is a bit rough around the edges in places but I will continue working on it.  See the ConsoleZMachine project for info on how to use the library.
